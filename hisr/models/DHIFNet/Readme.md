## Overview
Physical acquisition of high-resolution hyperspectral images (HR-HSI) has remained difficult, despite its potential of resolving material-related ambiguities in vision applications. Deep hyperspectral image fusion, aiming at reconstructing an HR-HSI from a pair of low-resolution hyperspectral image (LRHSI) and high-resolution multispectral image (HR-MSI), has become an appealing computational alternative. Existing fusion methods either rely on hand-crafted image priors or treat fusion as a nonlinear mapping problem, ignoring important physical imaging models. In this paper, we propose a novel regularization strategy to fully exploit the spatio-spectral dependency by a spatially adaptive 3D filter. Moreover, the joint exploitation of spatio-spectral regularization and physical imaging models inspires us to formulate deep hyperspectral image fusion as a differentiable optimization problem. We show how to solve this optimization problem by an end-to-end training of a model-guided unfolding network named DHIF-Net. Unlike existing works of simply concatenating spatial with spectral regularization, our approach aims at an end-to-end optimization of iterative spatio-spectral regularization by multistage network implementations. Our extensive experimental results on both synthetic and real datasets have shown that our DHIF-Net outperforms other competing methods in terms of both objective and subjective visual quality.
